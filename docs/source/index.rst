MSCG-Net Documentation
====================================
This project was designed to adapt the work of Liu et al. and
convert it to a mobile device which would allow for
in-the-field processing of images and much faster response
time and lower network requirements versus a computing cluster
that would typically be utilized for these sorts of tasks. While
working on this adaptation, we utilized two separate methods to
ensure flexibility of classification: a local method powered entirely
by the Android device for those phones with the computing capacity
to spare, and a REST-based method designed to take advantage of
existing networks and send the image back to a computer for offsite
processing, storage, and evaluation. The following paper
describes implementation, downloading and running instructions,
screenshots, and finally comments/critiques.
