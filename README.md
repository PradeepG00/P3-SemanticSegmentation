## Overview

This repository contains MSCG-Net models (MSCG-Net-50 and MSCG-Net-101) for semantic segmentation
in [Agriculture-Vision Challenge and Workshop](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Agriculture-Vision) (CVPR 2020), and the
pipeline of training and testing models, implemented in PyTorch. Please refer to our paper for
details:  [Multi-view SelfConstructing Graph Convolutional Networks with Adaptive Class Weighting Loss for Semantic Segmentation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w5/Liu_Multi-View_Self-Constructing_Graph_Convolutional_Networks_With_Adaptive_Class_Weighting_Loss_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf)

## Getting Started

### Project File Structure

```
├── checkpoints # output check point, trained weights, log files, tensorboard, etc
├── logs        # model runtime log and function tracing
├── models
├── train.py    # TODO: implement CLI using Click
├── train_R101.py
├── train_R50.py
└── utils       # model block, loss, utils code, # dataset loader and pre-processing code, config code, etc
```

### Dependencies

- python 3.5+
- pytorch 1.4.0
- opencv 3.4+
- tensorboardx 1.9
- albumentations 0.4.0
- pretrainedmodels 0.7.4
- others (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Configure your environment using either `virtual environment`, `anaconda`, or your choice of an environment manager
2. Run the following install the `mscg-net` package dependencies while in the project root directory

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # install  mscg-core dependencies
pip install -e .  # install mscg-core as a package which resolves the issue of pathing
```

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation

__NOTE__ the current implementation has been hardcoded to support
the [2021 dataset](https://www.agriculture-vision.com/agriculture-vision-2021/dataset-2021)

1. Change `DATASET_ROOT` to your dataset path in `./data/AgricultureVision/pre_process.py`

```
DATASET_ROOT = '/your/path/to/Agriculture-Vision'
```

2. Keep the dataset structure as the same with the official structure shown as below

```
.
├── test
│   ├── boundaries
│   ├── images
│   └── masks
├── train
│   ├── boundaries
│   ├── images
│   ├── labels
│   └── masks
└── val
    ├── boundaries
    ├── images
    ├── labels
    └── masks
```

[comment]: <> (#### Dataset Preparation: Known Pitfalls / Errors)

[comment]: <> (1. The current implementation __does NOT properly checks for proper generation of ground-truth__ files)

[comment]: <> (   - A quick-fix for this is remove the  )

### How to Train

__NOTE__ the current implementation __requires an NVIDIA GPU__

### Solution to Memory Issues on a Linux Machine (Ubuntu 20.04)

1. __IMPORTANT__ Set up the necessary memory to support training __NOTE__ this requires editing the `swap` memory file
   to allow up to __150gb__ of memory due to the existing implementation

```
# linux
sudo swapoff -a       # disable the current swap memory file
sudo fallocate -l <amount greater than 120>G /swapfile  # specify swap memory size  
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile  # configure user permissions 
sudo mkswap /swapfile   # create the swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile   # enable the newly created swap memory file
```

2. Run the following to train while inside the project root

```bash
python ./train_R50.py
python ./train_R101.py
```

### Remarks

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python ./tools/train_R50.py  # trained weights checkpoint1
# train_R101.py 								    # trained weights, checkpoint2
# train_R101_k31.py 							    # trained weights, checkpoint3
```

**Please note that:** we first train these models using Adam combined with Lookahead as the optimizer for the first 10k
iterations (around 7~10 epochs) and then change the optimizer to SGD in the remaining iterations. So you will have to **
manually change the code to switch the optimizer**
**to SGD** as follows:

```
# Change line 48: Copy the file name ('----.pth') of the best checkpoint trained with Adam
train_args.snapshot = '-------.pth'
...
# Comment line 92
# base_optimizer = optim.Adam(params, amsgrad=True)

# uncomment line 93
base_optimizer = optim.SGD(params, momentum=train_args.momentum, nesterov=True)
```

## Test with a single GPU

```
# To reproduce the leaderboard results (0.608), download the trained-weights checkpoint1,2,3
# and save them with the original names into ./checkpoint folder before run test_submission.py
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python ./tools/test_submission.py
```

#### Trained weights for  3 models download (save them to ./checkpoint before run test_submission)

58.7**</u> | 71.3| <u>**60.1**</u> | 53.4 |

Please note that all our single model's scores are computed with just single-scale (512x512) and single feed-forward
inference without TTA. TTA denotes test time augmentation (e.g. flip and mirror). Ensemble_TTA (checkpoint1,2) denotes
two models (checkpoint1, and checkpoint2) ensemble with TTA, and (checkpoint1, 2, 3) denotes three models ensemble.

### Model Size

| Models           | Backbones           | Parameters | GFLOPs | Inference time <br />(CPU/GPU ) |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| MSCG-Net-50      | Se_ResNext50_32x4d  | 9.59       | 18.21  | 522 / 26 ms                     |
| MSCG-Net-101     | Se_ResNext101_32x4d | 30.99      | 37.86  | 752 / 45 ms                     |
| MSCG-Net-101_k31 | Se_ResNext101_32x4d | 30.99      | 37.86  | 752 / 45 ms                     |

Please note that all backbones used pretrained weights on **ImageNet** that can be imported and downloaded from
the [link](https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorch#senet). And MSCG-Net-101_k31 has exactly the same
architecture wit MSCG-Net-101, while it is trained with extra 1/3 validation set (4,431) instead of just using the
official training images (12,901).
